# maintain a state field depending on some input
# and a template for a new value
# if the input has changed or there is no stub value the template is
# instantiated with the input as binding (reference input). 
# Alternatively the new value can be given as direct value.
# If a template is given, the template must provide a field
# `state` which is used as new state value.
#
# The result is a state structure with two fields
# - input: the input used to generate the actual value
# - value: the effectice value
#
# A state field should be put into a non-merging field.
# The actual state should be derived from this field
# and used as stub for successive merge calls.
#
#
# lambdas:
#
#  - utilities.state.data(input,new,forceupdate=false)
#
#    input:       any:             the input data used to generate the state
#                                  value
#    new:         template or and: the new value based on the input or
#                                  a template using the `input` binding to
#                                  generate the state value
#    forceupdate: bool:            setting to true encorces a value update
#
#  - utilities.state.standard(spec,forceupdate=false)
#
#    spec:        map:             structure containing the specification
#                                  for this state value
#    forceupdate: bool:            setting to true encorces a value update
#
#    the _spec_ map must contain two fields:
#         input: any               the input data used to generate the state
#                                  value
#         value: template or any   the new value based on the input or 
#                                  a template using the `input` binding to
#                                  generate the state value
